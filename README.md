My name is Seth Daniel and this is my ReadMe for the Lab 7 GitHub assignment.

I think using GitHub could be very beneficial because it seems to streamline collaboration.
It also does a good job of keeping records of what changes have been made and making it easy to revert back in order to fix mistakes. 

For these reasons I think GitHub is a very useful tool for coding projects.
